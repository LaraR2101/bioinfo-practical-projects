# bioinfo-projects
Collection of bioinformatics tools and analyses developed during 3 week university Practical Course, including protein structure visualization, genome analysis, and secondary structure prediction implementations. Tools cover sequence analysis, structural bioinformatics, and web-based applications.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Genome Analysis Tools
- Genome Report Parser: Analysis of prokaryotic genome data from NCBI
- Sequence Uniqueness Analyzer: Tool for analyzing unique k-mer sequences in bacterial genomes
- ENCODE Project Analysis: Processing and analysis of ENCODE project experimental data

### 2. Protein Structure Analysis
- PDB Structure Visualizer: Visualization and analysis of protein structures
- Contact Number Calculator: Implementation of protein contact analysis
- Secondary Structure Predictor: GOR algorithm implementation for protein secondary structure prediction
- (For GOR algorithm see: Garnier J, Gibrat JF, Robson B. GOR method for predicting protein secondary structure from amino acid sequence. Methods Enzymol. 1996;266:540-53.)

### 3. Web Interface
- CGI-based web interface for tool access
- Interactive visualization of results
- Integration of various analysis tool

## Course Information
